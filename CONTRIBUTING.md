# Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

To suggest a change:

1. Create a new branch with a name that summarizes your change, prefer branch names in kebab-case and short names.
2. Submit a pull request.

I will try to eventually review the pull request and possibly merge it. I cannot guarantee I will ever have time to do so.

Avoid very large pull requests. A pull request should focus on a single concern. If there are many changes to make, create multiple pull requests.
